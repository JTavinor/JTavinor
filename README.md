### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Joe Tavinor and I'm currently working towards becoming a professional dev. My main focus is on Front-End development using React, but I also create API's for my projects using Node with express. I am a self-taught programmer, and have completed multiple courses on Udemy and CodewithMosh. My main focus now is completing projects to improve my existing skills, as well as incrementally adding new abilities to my tech-stack.

## I'm currently working on ðŸ”­
My current project is building an app to build habits with a goal of long-term habit retention. I am using React with Redux for the front-end, and Node with Express to build out the API. On top of this I am learning Typescipt and TDD with Jest & Enzyme, which I am utilising in this project.

## Iâ€™m currently learning ðŸŒ±
As mentioned above I am currently learning Typescript. I'm loving the ability to set types (type hinting was one of my favourite Python features), as well as explicitly being able to see more issues in the code in the editor.  

Alongside this I am using TDD to build out the Slow Habits App. On the Front-end I am using Jest with Enzyme, and on the Back-end Jest with SuperTest. Although at this learning stage I am spending more time writing tests then functionality, I am looking forward to the reliability as well as confidence in refactoring/maintaining a larger app that testing will give. 

## Other projects
I have completed multiple projects, usually adding new libraries and skills with each one. These are my favourite two projects:

### Dengie Takeaways
<a href="https://jt-dengie-takeaways.herokuapp.com/">Link to Dengie Takeaways</a>

This is a demo takeaway app I made and deployed for my local area using React. I also used Redux for the first time, and after initially finding it quite confusing, I now love being able to store and access all state in a central store, as well as using Redux middleware to handle all API requests. The backend was built using Node with Express and MongoDB.

### Word Association Game
<a href="http://jtwordgame.herokuapp.com/">Word Association Game</a>  

A game where users have 3 lives or 90 seconds to score as much as possible by guessing an associated word for each prompt given (Words and associated words got via a 3rd party API). I added some cool features such as the ability to create an account, where you could delete scores from the leaderboard as well as seeing answers for any words you got wrong. Front-end made with React. Back-end made using Node with Express and MongoDB.

## Iâ€™m currently looking for
A chance to become a proffesional developer! My main interest lies in Front-End development, but I do have skills in building out RESTful API's, so am also willing to explore going down a Full-stack route.
