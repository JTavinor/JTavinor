### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Joe Tavinor and I'm currently working towards becoming a professional dev. My main focus is on Front-End development using React, but I also create API's for my projects using Node with express. I am a self-taught programmer, and have completed multiple courses on Udemy and CodewithMosh. My main focus now is completing projects to improve my existing skills, as well as incrementally adding new abilities to my tech-stack.

## I'm currently working on ðŸ”­
My current project is building an app to build habits with a goal of long-term habit retention. I am using React with Redux for the front-end, and Node with Express to build out the API. On top of this I am learning Typescipt and TDD with Jest & Enzyme, which I am utilising in this project.

## Iâ€™m currently learning ðŸŒ±
As mentioned above I am currently learning Typescript. I'm loving the ability to set types (type hinting was one of my favourite Python features), as well as explicitly being able to see more issues in the code in the editor.  

Alongside this I am using TDD to build out the Slow Habits App. On the Front-end I am using Jest with Enzyme, and on the Back-end Jest with SuperTest. Although at this learning stage I am spending more time writing tests then functionality, I am looking forward to the reliability as well as confidence in refactoring/maintaining a larger app that testing will give. 

## Iâ€™m currently looking for
A chance to become a proffesional developer! My main interest lies in Front-End development, but I do have skills in building out RESTful API's, so am also willing to explore going down a Full-stack route.
